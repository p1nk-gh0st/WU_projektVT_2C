                <p class="text">I'm currently a student settled in Sweden and in my spare time I love to make music and code things (but only when it works out for me well). I go by the online persona "<b>LUNACYLUNO</b>" and I love to experiment with my music. I am mainly and heavily inspired by a producer called <b>GING$ENG</b> and another one named <b>FIFTY GRAND</b>. I'd say that the biggest strength I have as a producer is that it's very easy for me to compose music and/or beats which speeds up the process and I'm usually done after 20~40mins. I also love to sample all kinds of weird stuff which also could be a strength as I always assure that the samples I use is unique and of good quality. I currently want to educate myself enough so I can work from home or work with virtual/technological stuff since it's interesting to me but my dream would be to produce music and make music full-time and make a living that way.</p></div>
